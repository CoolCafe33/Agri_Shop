# Agri_Shop

An e-commerce site that will help farmers post in their products in the platform and allowing customers to directly buy the products from the site. The front-end of this website is built using HTML, CSS and AngularJS. I have used Node.js for the backend development of this project. The project stores data in NoSQL database, MongoDB.
